# AI-Themed Portfolio Website

A cutting-edge portfolio website that uses transformer neural network architecture as both visual inspiration and functional navigation paradigm, showcasing expertise in electronics engineering and data science through innovative web development.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This portfolio transforms traditional static resume presentation into an interactive exploration of neural network concepts, demonstrating both technical competence and innovative thinking. The website itself becomes a demonstration of technical capability, where the medium truly becomes part of the message.

**Core Philosophy**: Every technical decision demonstrates professional engineering practices while maintaining focus on user experience and accessibility.

## 🧠 Transformer Theme Concept

The website architecture mirrors transformer neural networks:

- **Navigation System**: Acts as attention mechanisms that highlight related content across sections
- **Section Architecture**: Each major section (About, Projects, Experience) functions as an independent "layer" that can encode information and attend to other layers
- **Content Relationships**: Visualized through dynamic connections, mimicking how transformer attention weights show relationships between different parts of input sequences
- **Interactive Elements**: Provide immediate visual feedback using warm color gradients, creating a sense of system responsiveness

## 🚀 Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **Next.js 15+** with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **TypeScript** for enhanced type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for utility-first styling with custom design tokens

### Planned Integrations
- **Framer Motion** for smooth, performant animations
- **Three.js** for 3D neural network visualizations
- **D3.js** for interactive skills and project relationship graphs
- **Vercel** for deployment and performance optimization

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Color Palette
- **Base**: Pure black background for maximum contrast and modern aesthetic
- **Primary**: Golden orange (#FF8C42) for primary actions and highlights
- **Secondary**: Coral red (#FF6B6B) for attention-grabbing elements  
- **Tertiary**: Warm amber (#FFD93D) for subtle accents and success states
- **Text**: Warm white (#FEFEFE) for optimal readability

### Animation Principles
- **Purpose-Driven**: Animations enhance understanding rather than distract
- **Performance-Conscious**: Maintain 60fps across all devices
- **Accessible**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion

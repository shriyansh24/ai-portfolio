 * It maintains the provider pattern for consistent architecture.
 * 
 * Future enhancements could include:
 * - User interaction tracking for attention mechanism usage
 * - Page view analytics with transformer theme engagement metrics
 * - Performance monitoring for animation and visualization components
 * - A/B testing framework for different transformer visualization approaches
 * 
 * @param children - Child components that will have access to analytics context
